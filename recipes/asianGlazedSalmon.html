		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Super fast to make, it takes longer to cook the rice than this EASY Asian
			Salmon! The marinade only requires 5 ingredients – ginger, garlic, oyster
			sauce, sweet chili sauce and soy sauce. But it certainly tastes like it’s
			got more in it!
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 x 180g / 6oz salmon fillets</li>
			<li>Oil spray</li>
			<li>1 tsp fresh ginger</li>
			<li>1 garlic clove</li>
			<li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
			<li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
			<li>2 tbsp sweet chili sauce</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Marinade salmon – Combine the Marinade ingredients in a shallow bowl.
				Add salmon and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for 30 minutes or up to
				overnight.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preheat grill/broiler on high. Place the rack 25 cm / 10" from the heat
				source.
			</li>
			<li>
				Glaze – Place salmon on baking tray (no oil required, no paper – it will
				burn). Dab glaze onto the salmon, whatever will stick. Don't pour excess
				glaze on, it will pool around the salmon and burn.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook – Grill/broil for 7 minutes. Remove, spray the surface generously
				with oil. Grill/broil for another 1 to 3 minutes until the surface is
				caramelised at the salmon is cooked – the flesh should flake. (Internal
				temperature 50°C/122°F for medium rare – see Note 3) . Be careful not to
				overcook the salmon!
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve salmon sprinkled with sesame seeds, scallions/shallots with rice
				and steamed Asian greens on the side.
			</li>
