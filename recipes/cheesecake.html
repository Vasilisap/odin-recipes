		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This is a No Bake Cheesecake that tastes very similar to a classic Baked
			Cheesecake, made without the fuss of baking! It boasts an exceptionally
			smooth, light-yet-creamy filling and a buttery, crumbly crust that
			everybody is mad for.
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cream cheese</li>
			<li>Gelatine</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Whipping cream</li>
			<li>Sugar</li>
			<li>Vanilla</li>
			<li>Lemon juice</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Flip the base of a 20cm/8″ springform upside down.</li>
			<li>
				Clip with excess paper sticking out – Grease very lightly with butter,
				just enough to hold the paper in place so it’s not sliding around when
				you clip the sides in. Then top with a square sheet of paper and clip
				the sides in so the excess paper is sticking out.
			</li>
			<li>
				Break biscuits up roughly by hand and put them in a food processor.
			</li>
			<li>
				Blitz until they become fine crumbs, about 10 to 15 seconds on high,
				depending on how powerful your food processor is.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the butter, cinnamon, sugar and salt, then blitz again until it
				becomes wet sand.
			</li>
			<li>Wet sand! It should press together when pinched between fingers.</li>
			<li>
				Roughly press – Pour the crumbs into the prepared pan, roughly spread it
				around the base. Push it up the walls and press it up using a rubber
				spatula. No need to be overly neat at first, do it roughly initially
				then refine it (next step).
			</li>
			<li>
				Press and neaten – Use something with a flat base and vertical walls (I
				use a measuring cup) to press the crumbs firmly into the walls and the
				base. It will seem a little fragile at this stage but once the filling
				is in and the cheesecake has been refrigerated, the crust becomes firm
				and crispy.
			</li>
		</ol>
